Project Synopsis : 

Designing an app or a website for simulating space mining using microorganisms, also kwown as biomining.

*Features of the App/Website :

    1) Interactive Biomining Process Visualization :
    -Users can simulate how microbes extract materials from lunar, Martian, or asteroid regolith.
    -Include sliders to adjust conditions like temperature, pH, radiation levels, or gravity.

    2) Microbial Behavior Simulation :
    -Display how selected microbes function under different space conditions.
    -Show animations of microbes interacting with regolith particles and extracting metals or volatiles.

    3) Choose a Scenario :
    -Lunar Mining: Focus on extracting oxygen and metals.
    -Martian Soil: Explore water extraction for fuel or agriculture.
    -Asteroid Mining: Simulate extracting rare metals like platinum.

    4) Educational Content :
    -Explain the biomining process, the role of microbes, and the challenges of space resource utilization.
    -Provide details about the materials being mined and their applications.

    5) Resource Efficiency Tracker :
    -Show a dashboard calculating the efficiency of resource extraction and its sustainability compared to terrestrial mining.

    6) Design Your Microbe :
    -Let users "customize" a microbe by selecting traits like radiation resistance or pH tolerance.
    -Visualize the impact of their design choices on mining efficiency.

    7)Space Environment Simulator :
    -Simulate harsh space condtiions (e.g., vacuum, radiation, temperature extremes) and see how they affect mining output.
