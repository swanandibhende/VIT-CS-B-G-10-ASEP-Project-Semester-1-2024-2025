Space Radiation Simulator

1] Project Objective
Develop a simulation to analyze how different materials shield against space radiation.
Focus on modeling radiation types, material interactions, and visualizing results.
Focus on Data analysis and visualization.


2] Tools and Technologies

Programming Languages:
Python (preferred): Libraries like numpy, matplotlib, plotly.
C++ (for advanced tools like GEANT4, optional).

Simulation Frameworks:
Custom Python Code: Use Monte Carlo methods for simplicity.
GEANT4/MCNP: Advanced simulation toolkits (optional).

Visualization Tools:
Static plots: matplotlib, seaborn.
Interactive dashboards: plotly, dash.
3D visualization (optional): Unity or Three.js.

Development Environment:
Visual Studio Code.
Git and GitHub for version control.

Data Sources:
NIST XCOM database (material properties and attenuation coefficients).
NASA/ESA radiation flux data.


3] Simplified Workflow

Research Phase:
Learn about radiation physics and material shielding properties.

Modeling Phase:
Write code to simulate radiation passing through materials.
Implement Monte Carlo methods to simulate particle paths.

Simulation Phase:
Test different materials and thicknesses.
Analyze shielding effectiveness.

Visualization Phase:
Create graphs (e.g., radiation intensity vs. thickness).
Build interactive dashboards or animations for particle behavior.

Presentation Phase:
Compile findings with visualizations and technical explanations.

4] Optional Features
Develop a GUI for user interaction (e.g., using Tkinter or Dash).
Create a web-based interface using Flask or React.
Include real-world radiation data for validation.
