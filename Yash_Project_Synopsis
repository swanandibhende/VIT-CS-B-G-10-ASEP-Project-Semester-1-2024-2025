Project Objective: To create as small as possible working 'Space Rover' with functions like Sample Collection, 
                    Obstacle Detection, Lifeform Detection, Mining Capabilities, Decision Making.

Functions of 'Space Rover' and their uses:

                1) Sample Collection: By Use of Machine Learning "Rover" will be functioned 
                   for 'Sample Collection' and used to collect Minerals, Resourses and Data
                   of the 'Planet' or 'Asteroid'.


                2) Obstacle Detection: By use of Sensors "Rover" will be functioned to avoid
                                       collision with nearby obstacle.

                3) Lifeform Detection: The use of Infrared Sensors is to detect the presence
                                       of life and to gain information about temperature at 
                                       specific location.

                3) Minning Capabilities: By use of Machine Learning "rover" will be functioned  
                                         to mine in 'Hard Rocks' and 'Planet Surface'. Type of
                                         mining involved is Drilled Mining, Vein Mining, Strip
                                         Mining.

                4) Decision Making: By using 'Artificial Intelligence' Rover will make its own 
                                    dicision by which above fuctionwill be enhanced. 

Tecnology Used in the Project:
                1) Artificial Intelligence [for enhancing functions]
                2)Machine Learning [to train rover to do such activity]
                3)Programming Language such as C,C++,MATLAB,etc.
                4)Space Organistion's Reaseached Data.

[I HAVE CONSIDERED THIS A LONG TERM PROJECT SO MORE FUCTIONS WILL BE ADDED LATER THEREFORE FOR FIRST YEAR WE WOULD DO ONLY SOME OF THE GIVEN FUCTIONS IN OUR "SPACE ROVER"]
